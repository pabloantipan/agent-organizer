## Goal
Pablo finds every recipient in the same place in every composer, and the chat list never hides its own head or a row he clicked.

## Gate
docs/specs/leftovers-51.md, rows K1-K5 and X0; the UI review checks review-view R46 to R49.

## Done
- l51-comp, 2026-10-24: FR-1 to FR-5 on branch lf51-composers (97c8a79, 3dbe032, d7605a9), rebased on main 48c77ac; K1-K5 fail on main and pass on the branch, X0 passes from a clean clone; commands and output in .wt-notes/l51-comp/progress.md.

## Declared changes
- added `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:recipientsOf`: the one recipient list (roster, then Others, then an addressee in neither under Others), FR-1
- added `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:RecipientOptions`: draws recipientsOf in every composer's select
- deleted `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:shownSeats`: appended a name outside the list
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:ReplyBox`: takes `others`, draws RecipientOptions
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:RuleBox`: exported, takes `others`, draws RecipientOptions
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:NewThread`: draws RecipientOptions
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:NeedsMe`: passes `others` to its RuleBoxes
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:Conversation`: rows in a `.chats-rows` scroller under the Chats head (FR-2); row clicks pass the row and scroller to the reveal (FR-3); passes `others` to ReplyBox and NeedsMe
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:rowReveal`: `click(key, row, list)` reveals a cut row, nearest and instant (FR-3)
- added `frontend/src/components/Conversation.tsx:isCut`: whether the scroller cuts a row
- modified `frontend/src/styles/global.css`: `.chats` no longer scrolls, `.chats-rows` does (FR-2); the marked controls' base and hover transitions removed, `button` dropped from the reduced-motion block, `button:disabled` `transition: none` (FR-4)
- added `frontend/src/components/Conversation.composers.test.tsx`: K1, K2, K3
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.reveal.test.tsx`: K3 through Conversation's click handlers
- modified `frontend/src/components/Conversation.landing.test.tsx`: L2 replaced by K4
- modified `scripts/fixture-home.sh`: `--review` writes a stand-in token for organizer-fixture/pablo and exports DISCUSS_BIND at an absent socket (FR-5)
Risky:
- `global.css`: every button's transition is now the base rule's 100 ms on background, border and colour; before, the reduced-motion block made it .12 s without colour
- `fixture-home.sh --review`: with a token, Conversations shows mailbox errors (absent socket) it used to hide behind "no token"
Not changed, on purpose:
- `frontend/src/styles/shell.css`, `roles.css`, `overview.css`, `work.css`: their own base transitions on some buttons are outside the boundary and the marked-controls list
- `internal/discuss`: the client still dials DISCUSS_BIND else 127.0.0.1:9494; the fixture points it away instead
- other `fixture-home.sh` modes: byte for byte as before

## Notes
- l51-comp: FR-4 eases hover both ways on `--ease-out` from the base rule; Amendment 15 UL4 also names `--ease-exit` for the way out, which a base-only rule cannot carry. Reviewer's call whether that matters for R49.
